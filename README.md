# Crow
The Social Media Site for the Night's Watch (no Lannisters allowed, except Tyrion)

TO use this mockup: 

1. open your terminal to where you downloaded this folder then run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' 
2. Create a SQL server through the terminal command 'createdb warbler'
3. using python3, run 'python3 seed.py' (this will populate a SQL server with mock users)
4. run the server using the 'flask run' command within the server :)

Welcome to the Night's Watch, brother
